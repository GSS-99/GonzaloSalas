    <li><h3><em>Grease</em>, by Randal Kleiser</h3></li>

    <h4>SINOPSIS</h4>
     <p> Good girl Sandy Olsson and greaser Danny Zuko fell in love over 
          the summer. When they unexpectedly discover they're now in the 
          same high school, will they be able to rekindle their romance?

     <h4>REVIEW</h4>
     <p>I've positioned <em> Grease </em> number one for its undeniable impact
     in pop culture (and for being my ultimate comfort musical movie to watch).
     From the iconic songs and videoclips, to the cast performance and 50's nostalgia aesthetic.
      Plus that late 70's film production that makes it so cozy and familiar, the experience 
      of watching <em>Grease</em> is just magical.</p>

      The musical has it all: from funny and energetic songs like <em> Greased Lightning</em>,
       to intimate ones where we can see some characters showing their most vulnerable side, fx:
        <em> There Are Worse Things I Could Do</em>. It even has a dangerous car race! And 
        don't get me started with that dreamy surreal ending.. <em>Danny</em> and <em>Sandy</em>
         saying goodbye in their flying car while <em>We Go Together</em> plays on forever...</p>
