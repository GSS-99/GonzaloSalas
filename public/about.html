<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Gonzalo Salas. Born in Spain, permanently living in Denmark
   since 2022.</p>

<p>My professional journey has been in creative productions and restaurant
   services. I've experienced being in control of a project and working as
    a team member as well. Either way this provided me a deep understanding
     of effective communication, adaptability, the value of creating a
      collaborative work environment and overall, responsibility.</p>

<p> I'm studying Software Development but my background studies are in TV,
   Filming and Live Shows Production. I'm fluent in both English and Spanish,
    with basic knowledge in Danish.</p>
